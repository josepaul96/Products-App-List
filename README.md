# Products-App-List

#General Information

A simple web app that displays a few products with options to add more products or delete products. My first project with a backend integration with Angular 10. Helped me familiarise with Angular and strengthened my experience with ExpressJS, NodeJS, MongoDB Atlas, Mongoose.
Since this was to undertsand some basic aspects of Angular, the login and registeration has no significance, but is simply present for practice.
